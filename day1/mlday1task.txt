MACHINE LEARNING:
    Machine Learning is used to make the machines smarter instead of application
Basically ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence in which their prime focus is to make
Application smarter.
     Machine Learning is categorize into 3 different parts :
1)Supervised Leaning
2)Unsupervised learning
3)Reinforcement learning

In supervised learning all the basic data has been feeded in the machine 
Based on that analysis the machine makes the decision and work on that.
For eg: detection between normal email and spam email
In unsupervised learning there is no data feeded prior it works on some 
Unknown pattern and makes the decision.
For eg: seperating the group of people with the same qualification, etc
In reinforment learning the machine works on the observers reaction means 
Like a small kid if he/she has told to put the soft toys and hard toy to a different boxes
If he/she does the wrong by seeing the reaction of parents they will learn the right
Thing just like that by giving the reward an punishment through the program 
It can learn the thing by observing or doing the things practically
